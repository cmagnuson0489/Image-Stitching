 # Image-Stitching
- The purpose of this program will be to stitch two images together using OpenCV and C++ and create one single panoramic image.
- Perform feature detection and matching as well.

# Feature Development

# Multi Image Stitiching

- I plan to expand this program to allow you to stitch more than two images at a time. 
- As a part of stitching multiple images this program will be able to perform automatic and alignment of images into a sequence to create a larger panormama.

# User Input
- Provide options for users to manually adjust the keypoints or regions of interest if the automatic stitching doesnâ€™t provide satisfactory results. T
- This will be helpful in cases where automatic feature matching fails.

# Error Handling and Feedback
- Implement comprehensive error handling to deal with different failure modes (e.g., no features found, poor matches). 
- Provide useful feedback to the user about what might have gone wrong.

# Make this program easily accessible

- Create a web interface for the  program.  
- I may possubly use a framework like Flask or Django for the backend, which can handle C++ executable calls or Python equivalents.
